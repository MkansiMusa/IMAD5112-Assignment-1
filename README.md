The app will ask students to input age then it will retrieve information of who passed away at that age and will display the information to the user. The app will provide students with the following information when they passed away, age and the field they specialized in. The apps design considerations and the strategic of GitHub Actions in its development.
App functionality

Example 
 
Purpose of the app 
The purpose of this app is to make the history of famous people who have passed away easy to access and the app’s aim is to achieve the following objectives. 
User engagement: The app is designed to be user friendly so that students can easily interact with the app. This will make students want to use the app because it will be easy for them to interact with it.
Educating: By comparing different ages, the app will work as an education center the will educate on famous figures that have passed away this will help students understand more about the lives lives of influential people that passed away so that they will be inspired to follow their footstep or try to better themselves.
Designing the user interface
When designing the History App, we made sure that the app would be user friendly for greater engaging experience. While designing the interface the following factors were put into consideration 
Goal-focused design: We made sure that we are consistent will the design we didn’t try and use a lot of different designs into our page that will end up irritating the user. 
Human oriented design: when designing the interface to align with the goal of the application so that when the user interacts with the application, he or she doesn’t get confused.
Inter-cultural design: When developing the interface, it was understood that the app will be used by different users with different cultures so we made sure that we don’t base the design to a certain culture so that all kinds of people can use the app.
Use of negative space: When developing the app, we made sure that we don’t add any unnecessary pictures or designs that don’t need to be added to the interface because adding a lot of unnecessary things to the interface will just confuse the user. 
Colour transfer meaning: By choosing the correct colours it will help the user have an idea of the brand of your application.
Length of content: Putting too much information on your application will end up boring or making the user less interested so we tried to put only the information that is needed to try and keep the user hooked to the app. 
Adding easy navigation button: We didn’t try and confuse the user by adding complicated navigation button to the interface so that it can be easy for the user to navigate through the app.
Summary 
When a user interacts with your application the first thing they see, so we tried to make that it is user friendly and it is not badly designed because in most cases the interface determines if people will use your application or not.
Interface Example 
 
Utilization of GitHub and GitHub Actions
GitHub is  platform used to manage projects, code reviews and issue tracking it also offer more features. Here are ways in which you utilize GitHub and GitHub Actions 
Version Control: it provides a platform which allows developers to change their code on the repositories and allow collaboration with other developers.
Collaboration: It allows developers to collaborate with each other through code review and pull requests 
Code Quality Analysis: it has a lot of code analysis tools to help check the quality of your code.
Custom Workflows: it allows flexibility for defining custom workflow tailored to a specific project. 
In short GitHub offers different tools for streamlining the software development process to improve collaboration between different developers so that we can get quality and reliable code.
Conclusion 
History app offers student and application that is user friendly and that will give student a chance to learn history through the lifespans and famous figures who have passed on, with the interface that is easily to use and an application that will give reliable information to students. 
The app aims to create a deeper understanding of the live of famous figures and to create an environment that encourage students to follow in the foot steps of their idols that have passed on.
